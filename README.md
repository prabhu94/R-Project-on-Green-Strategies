# R-Project-on-Green-Strategies
Studying the Effects of Green Infrastructure Strategies using R

Project description

1) The dataset consisted of information from different plots and areas under the local municipality.
2) These lots had areas with tree spaces and open areas.
3) The primary objective was to find out the effect of open spaces or tree spaces, on the price of the lot and determining rebates to be issued to owners of the lots based on this effect using multivariate linear regression.
4) The secondary objective was to predict the environmental impact of having rain gardens or trees in the lots using the regression coefficients in terms of runoff reduced.
